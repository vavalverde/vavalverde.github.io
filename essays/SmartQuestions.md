## Who Am I to Judge?
In the course of my many professions as a welcome assistant, Starbucks employee, and military personnel I have developed a nuanced perspective that challenges the conventional wisdom encapsulated in the phrase, "there is no such thing as a stupid question." My stance revolves around the recognition that unwise questions are not uncommon often originating from a reluctance to proactively engage in the essential groundwork required to arrive at a solution. I have observed that a considerable number of inquiries could be effectively addressed through the judicious use of resources such as a straightforward Google search or a thoughtfully crafted query in a related context. The latter approach involves exploring solutions tangential to the immediate question, thereby fostering a more comprehensive understanding.

To illustrate this point, while resolving a basic arithmetic problem like 2+2  if a direct solution cannot be found it is reasonable to expect individuals to explore tutorials on addition and its practical applications. It is imperative to acknowledge that not all answers are readily accessible; some demand a proactive investment of effort from the inquirer. By advocating for preliminary research before seeking external assistance we contribute to a more streamlined exchange of information and instill a mindset of self-reliance in the pursuit of effective problem-solving.

The characteristics of smart questions, as indicated in "How to ask questions the smart way" by Eric Raymond, include:

1-Clarity and Specificity: Smart questions are clear and specific, providing sufficient context and information for others to understand and assist.

2-Demonstration of Effort: Askers are encouraged to show that they have made an effort to find answers independently. This involves searching archives, reading documentation, and experimenting before seeking help.

3-Engagement and Willingness to Learn: Smart questions reflect an attitude of engagement, thoughtfulness, and a willingness to actively participate in problem-solving.

4-Respect for the Community: Askers are advised to respect the norms and expectations of the community, choosing appropriate forums and demonstrating an understanding of the culture.

## Smart Questions
Example Smart Question:
I accidentally committed the wrong files to Git, but didn't push the commit to the server yet.
How do I undo those commits from the local repository?

Clarity: The question is clear and concise. The asker specifies that they accidentally committed the wrong files to Git but have not pushed the commit to the server.

Context: The question provides context about the specific situation. It mentions that the mistake is in the local repository and has not been pushed to the server, offering crucial information for potential solutions.

Demonstration of Effort: While the asker may have made a mistake, the act of asking the question itself demonstrates an effort to rectify the situation. The asker is actively seeking guidance on how to undo the commits.

The Answer: 

Clarity and Detail: The answer is presented in a clear and detailed step-by-step format, making it easy for the asker to follow the instructions. Each step is well-explained, and comments are included for better understanding.

Command Explanation: Each Git command used in the solution is explained, helping the asker understand the purpose of each step. This adds value by educating the asker about the Git commands being employed.

## Not Smart Questions
Not Smart Question:

This is a question from someone's homework

Incomplete Code Context: The code snippet provided is part of a larger context that is not shown. 

Confusion in the Question: The asker states confusion about when the code returns i. This confusion could be clarified by specifying what specific scenarios or conditions they are uncertain about. It's not entirely clear what aspect of the !strcmp condition is causing confusion.

They state it is their homework in the question

Result:
The not smart question leads to many down votes and a reluctantcy to answer the question.
