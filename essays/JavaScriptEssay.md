In the field of programming languages, JavaScript stands out with a unique flair that I find both intriguing and refreshing. What captivates me is JavaScript's "just-in-time" style, which differs from Python and Java's more structured syntax. While Python and Java are similar to meticulously planned architectures, JavaScript feels more like an improvisational dance allowing for greater flexibility and creativity in code. It's a language that fosters experimentation as opposed to the more strict structures I've previously encountered.

As an outsider to JavaScript, my journey seems like traversing familiar territory on a strange map. Having a foundation in Java and Python aided the initial steps as there were similarities in logic and syntax. However, the online course, which covered both basic JavaScript and ES6, gave a solid foundation. Despite the significant amount of time it required, lucky for me I had plenty of time while getting my car tires changed, the investment paid off by building a solid understanding for someone with no prior expertise.

Personally, I love JavaScript's informal approach, but I understand my professor's concern about potential drawbacks in more complex systems. While the flexibility of the language encourages creativity, it can be difficult to maintain code integrity over time especially in large-scale engineering projects.

Transitioning to athletic software engineering, the in-class workouts or WODs, proved initially nerve-racking. However, the fear turned into a fantastic learning opportunity. These exercises not only train us for real-world teamwork, but also improve our problem-solving abilities. Witnessing different approaches from my group during practice WODs highlighted the importance of collaboration. It was amazing to see the variety of solutions created by each team member and it really put into perspective the opportunity we would've missed t learning had we not been sorted into random groups.

WODs produce tension, which converts into a sense of success as challenges are overcome. It's a fun and challenging learning technique that reflects the changing nature of the tech industry and also to make sure we study. While saying goodbye to my previous group is difficult, the thought of working with new peers excites me. The first practice WOD informed me that while tough this method of learning will be beneficial throughout the semester.
