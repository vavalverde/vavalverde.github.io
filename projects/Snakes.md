Welcome to the sophisticated world of the Snake Game, a captivating and elegantly designed project crafted using Java in Eclipse. This project showcases classic Snake Game mechanics but also incorporates advanced features, polished user interface, and efficient code architecture.

The Snake Game is a timeless classic, and my project aims to elevate this simplicity to sophistication. The game revolves around a snake that grows longer as it consumes food items, with the challenge lying in avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own tail. 

   The game engages players from the moment they launch the application. The colorful palette, intuitive layout, and smooth animations contribute to a visually appealing experience. My Snake Game is not confined to a fixed window size. It adapts seamlessly to various screen resolutions, ensuring an optimal gaming experience across different devices. Whether you're playing on a desktop or a laptop, the game adjusts its layout for maximum enjoyment.
